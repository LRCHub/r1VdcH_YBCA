Move on down
Move on down
The road goes on for miles
We can drive
We can spit
The wind will mark our words

I'm left for dead now
I'm left for dead right now
We're left alone now
We're left alone right now

Teach me Texarkana
A tour with no words
The weapons drawn
Rock n' roll is war

I'm left for dead now
I'm left for dead right now
We're left alone now
We're left alone right now

We looked away from ourselves
We looked away from ourselves
Our vans die
I don't care
Our vans die
I don't care
